    <h2>A Brief Introduction...</h2>
    <p> <font size=6>The creation of this portfolio provided me with a chance to reflect on both my web coding skills in several years.  As you browse around, I hope that you are able to gain a strong sense for who I am as a web developer and how I incorporate my project in the classroom.  Each section of this portfolio represents a small piece of information that reflects who I am and what I am capable of.</font> </p>
